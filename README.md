# Sustainability Aspects of Software Architecture 

This is the code repository for my masters thesis _"Influence of software architecture on the sustainability of a software system"_ (Original German Title: _"Einfluss von Softwarearchitektur auf die Nachhaltigkeit eines Softwaresystems"_).
This repository contains every code artefact created during the work on the thesis. 

## Case Study 1: Caching in a Three-Layer-Architecture

## Case Study 2: Merge Microservices into a Monolithic

**Note that this repository just includes the artefacts that has been created indepentenly for the thesis. Code artefacts of the whole project "The Microservice Dungeon" can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/the-microservice-dungeon/)**
